## What's a branch?

A branch is a reference to a commit. When HEAD points to a branch, we're "on" that branch. Making a commit on a branch, the branch is updated to refer to the new commit.

## What's HEAD?

HEAD is a reference to the "current branch" or sometimes a commit. Git commands like `status`, `log`, and `branch` use HEAD to refer to a different branch.
